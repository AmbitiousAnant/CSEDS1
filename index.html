    Chess is a board game for two players. It is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a square board consisting of 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns, with each type of piece having a different pattern of movement. An enemy piece may be captured (removed from the board) by moving one's own piece onto the square it occupies. The object of the game is to "checkmate" (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.

The recorded history of chess goes back to at least the emergence of chaturanga—also thought to be an ancestor to similar games like Janggi, xiangqi and shogi—in seventh-century India. After its introduction in Persia, it spread to the Arab world and then to Europe. The modern rules of chess emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, with millions of players worldwide.

Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the International Chess Federation. The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Gukesh Dommaraju is the current World Champion, having won the title in 2024.

A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and the arts, and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology. One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory; however, chess is not a solved game.

Rules

<p id="para2"> THIS IS PARAGRAPH 2
    The rules of chess are published by FIDE and are revised periodically. The rules of chess are generally consistent worldwide, with some variations for play in specific regions or events. The following is a summary of the most important rules.
    The game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks and numbered 1 to 8) and eight columns (called files and lettered a to h). The squares are alternately light and dark. Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces of six different types: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. One player controls the white pieces, and the other controls the black pieces. White moves first, then players alternate moves. A move consists of moving one piece to another square, capturing an enemy piece on that square if present, and removing it from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece (a piece controlled by the same player). With the exception of castling, a player may not make a move that places or leaves their own king in check (under threat of capture). If a player's king is in check, the player must make a move that eliminates the threat of capture on their next turn. If no such move exists, the player's king is in checkmate, and the game is over.
    The most basic moves are those of the pawn and the knight. A pawn moves forward one
    square, if that square is unoccupied. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares forward provided both squares in front of the pawn are unoccupied. A pawn captures diagonally, one square forward and to the left or right. A pawn has two special moves: en passant and promotion. En passant (in passing) is a special pawn capture that can occur immediately after an opponent moves a pawn two squares forward from its starting position, and an adjacent friendly pawn could have captured it had it moved only one square forward. The friendly pawn captures the just-moved enemy pawn "in passing" as if the enemy pawn had moved only one square forward. Promotion occurs when a pawn reaches the farthest rank from its starting position (the opponent's first rank); it is then exchanged for the player's choice of a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color (the piece is "promoted" to that piece). The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces; thus, a player may have more than one queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
    A knight moves to any of the squares immediately adjacent to it and then makes one further step
    at a right angle. Thus, the knight has up to eight possible moves. A knight is the only piece that can "jump" over other pieces.
    The rook moves any number of vacant squares along a rank or file. It also is moved
    when castling.
    The bishop moves any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.
    The queen moves any number of vacant squares in any direction: vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
    The king moves one square in any direction. The king also has a special move called cast
    ling, in which the king moves two squares toward a rook on the player's first rank, then the rook moves to the square over which the king crossed. Castling is permissible only if the king and rook have never moved, if the squares between them are unoccupied, if the king is not in check, and if the king does not pass through or end up on a square that is under attack by an enemy piece.

    A game can end in a win for one player or a draw. A player wins by checkmating the opponent's king. This occurs when the king is in check and no legal move can be made to escape check. A game is a draw if the player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and their king is not in check (a stalemate), if there is insufficient material to force a checkmate (for example, a king against a king, or a king and bishop against a king), if the same position is repeated three times with the same player to move, or if fifty consecutive moves have been made by each side without the movement of any pawn and without any capture. A draw may also be agreed upon by both players at any time during the game.
    In tournament play, players are usually required to record their moves on a scoresheet. This allows for the reconstruction of the game later for study or adjudication. In addition, it serves as proof of the moves made in case of disputes. Most high-level tournaments now use digital recording methods, such as electronic boards that automatically record moves.

White is in checkmate, being unable to escape attack by the bishop on f3.<br><br>

When a king is under immediate attack, it is in check. A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position in which the king is no longer in check. There are three ways to counter a check:

Capture the checking piece.
Interpose a piece between the checking piece and the king (possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king).
Move the king to a square where it is not under attack.
The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to get it out of check. In casual games, it is common to announce "check" when putting the opponent's king in check, but this is not required by the rules of chess and is usually not done in tournaments.[5]
